### Recap: Discrete objects &#8211; vector

<div>
  Points, lines and polygons. They are all based on one or more coordinate pairs. One coordinate pair (x,y) for points. Two coordinate pairs for a straight line (for more bends, add more coordinate pairs). Areas represented using polygons: straight lines between points, always returning to the beginning.
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  Polygons consist of line consist of points consist of coordinates.
</div>

<div>
</div>

### Recap: continuous fields &#8211; raster data

<div>
  Grid (raster) consists of cells (pixels). Each pixel has one value, used to resemble one attribute for that area. The resolution, the size of the pixels, representing the size of the cell in map units (width x height). Raster pixels is not used to resemble the object. Only to represent the attribute values within the area the cells are covering. So from last time, when there is variation within one pixel, we must choose what to display, for example mean value.
</div>

<div>
</div>

### Correlation

<div>
  If the values follow each other in a smooth way, we are talking about serial correlation. Points near each other in time is similar to each other. Positive and negative serial correlation. Most things we experience follow each other in time. Consecutive, successive, events through time has similarities. One directional causality. Its more understandable than space, because it moves one way.
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  similarities across space has many directions simultaneously. Recap Tobler&#8217;s first law of geography. For example socio-economic relations, house types, industry types, we often see agglomerations.
</div>

<div>
  Spatial heterogeneity shows a lot of variety within an area. Spatial homogeneity shows low levels of variations. But similarity where? The larger the area we study, the higher chances of more variation. By increasing the distance we will have an increasing number of differing values. Some geographical phenomenons varies smoothly across the extent of space, others are more irregular. Smoothness.
</div>

<div>

<div>
  ”Everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things&raquo;
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  Similarities in position and similarities in values. Positive spatial autocorrelation has similarity in both position and attributes. Negative spatial correlation has the opposite.
</div>

>   &#8216;Spatial autocorrelation’ is the correlation among values of a single variable strictly attributable to their relatively close locational positions on a two-dimensional (2-D)surface, introducing a deviation from the independent observations assumption of classical statistics.Spatial auto correlation exists because real-world phenomena are typified by orderliness, (map) pattern, and systematic concentration, rather than randomness. Tobler’s first law of geography encapsulates this situation: ‘‘everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things.’’To this maximum should be added the qualifier: ‘‘but not necessarily through the same mechanisms.’’ In other words, spatial autocorrelation means a dependency exists between values of a variable in neighboring or proximal locations, or a systematic pattern in values of a variable across the locations on a map due to underlying common factors. (Griffith 2009)

### Moran&#8217;s I(-ndex)

<div>
  We can locate clusters in where people choose to live, where they work, what type of vegetation exists. Although we see similar outcomes in many different fields, they are results of very different mechanisms. We measure spatial autocorrelation using Moran&#8217;s I(-ndex) from minus 1 to plus 1.  -1 means maximum negative correlation, plus one means total positive correlation. Similar to an R2 value in statistics, but it takes position into account. R2 takes correlation in values, Moran&#8217;s I shows correlation between values and position.
</div>

<div>
  Moran&#8217;s I is them most used indicator for spatial autocorrelation. Works with both vector and raster data. 1- is high negative spatial autocorrelation, 0 is no spatial autocorrelation and +1 is high positive spatial autocorrelation.<br clear="none" /><img class="en-media" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.evernote.com/shard/s116/res/1ec0bc9e-9361-4850-af92-24d8f8d37422/m_5809d478222bebfd958427965c25fb4a.gif?w=700&#038;ssl=1" alt="" name="1ec0bc9e-9361-4850-af92-24d8f8d37422" data-recalc-dims="1" />
</div>

<div>
  What makes the church bodies agglomerate, this positive spatial correlation? Spatial autocorrelations can reveal patterns to us that was completely invisible before we started connecting the data.
</div>

<div>
  What about negative spatial correlation? It appears that negative spatial autocorrelation is likely to occur when competition between regions (or agents) outweigh cooperative factors.
</div>

### Global and local measures

<div>
  Global measure is a single value that applies to the whole of the data set. The same pattern or process occurs over the entire geographic area, or it could be an average for the entire area.
</div>

<div>
  Local measures are a value calculated for each observation unit. Different patterns and processes may occur in different parts of the region. A unique number for each location.
</div>

<div>
  <em>An equivalent local measure can be calculated for most of the global measures.</em>
</div>

### Spatial influences

<div>
  Events in space can affect events in many directions at the same time. SUdden events (extreme weather). political decision (wages in municipality): First one municipality ups the wages for nurses, at first it will differ from nearby municipality, but then usually the difference will smoothen out over time. Settlement patterns: Living with like-minded (cultural, political and economic), or does living in an area effect you somehow? Over time it will create positive autocorrelation.
</div>

### What creates spatial dependency

<div>
  One geographic unit&#8217;s (I) choices, depends on a nearby geographic unit&#8217;s (j) choices and vice versa. Most socio-economic factors show some degree of positive spatial autocorrelation.
</div>

  * An example: High positive spatial autocorrelation is seen with the NDVI (vegetation index) with satellite imagery.
  * Another example: Moderate positive spatial autocorrelation is often seen in population data.

### Autocorrelation and prediction

<div>
  In statistical analysis we assume that units are independent from each other. Independent and Identically Distributed (IID), random variables. If the units are spatial dependent, this assumption is violated and the results will be biased. Uncertainty will be falsely low. From this we can move into spatial statistics or spatial econometrics.
</div>

### Data selection

<div>
  We are trying to create representations of reality, but we cannot collect all data and present all things in our maps. Therefor we need to sample. What we sample limits what representations we can construct. &laquo;Geographic data are only as good as the sampling scheme used to make them.
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  There are several different sampling methods. Here are 7 of them.
</div>

  1. Random selections
  2. Stratified selection
  3. Stratified random selection
  4. Stratified selection with random grid-variations
  5. Cluster selection
  6. Cross-sectional selection
  7. Contour line selection

<div>
  We should preferably sample with most precision in the areas where variability is high: Disproportional stratified selection.
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  Whenever we work with data, we usually find data online that has been used before, but for another purpose. When we work in the group project, we search for it at the Oslo Municipality, the Norwegian Kartverk. Data collected by other parties can be used for other purposes, but remember to check metadata to know the quality of the data.
</div>

### How to fill empty space

<div>
  We base our representation on samples. But we need some way to fill in the empty spaces between our samples. Then we need to have a qualified understanding of how we can represent the areas where we do not sample. That is called <strong>interpolation.</strong> This is the prediction of empty space using interpolation. Best estimates based on our data.
