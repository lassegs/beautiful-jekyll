### Previous lecture:

  * GIS in everyday use
  * What is GIS
  * Historical development
  * Critiques
  * Why do we need GIS
  * Georeferenced and not georeferenced information
  * Examples

<div>
  As we read in chapter 1 there are several definitions for GIS. One is a tool for creating maps. Maps are what we are going to learn about today.
</div>

<div>
  Since everything happens someplace, it can be mapped, located, and analyzed for patterns etc. We use GIS to answer spatial questions. Where something is, what something is, trends over time, patterns, calculations and modelling.
</div>

### Today&#8217;s lecture

  * Why this topic?
  * GIS in research
  * What is a map
  * Message of a map
  * Types of map
  * Map design
  * Power of maps

<div>
  We&#8217;re talking about map design which is basically cartography. It&#8217;s important to understand how to make a map, because spatial analysis alone can&#8217;t communicate what you have done.
</div>

### Why this topic

<div>
  We use maps to share information. It&#8217;s important then to remember why you are making this map: What are you trying to communicate.
</div>

<div>
  The map is an important component of a GIS (But not the only thing
</div>

<div>
  A medium to make the spatial information communicate to the reader
</div>

<div>
  Need to know about how a map is composed, and also how
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  So today we&#8217;re talking about how we present our data and results.
</div>

### GIS and maps in research

<div>
  The geographer begins by obtaining data. We will be given data in the labs. But for our project we will have to gather the data ourselves. We take this data, analyze and calculate on it, and then present it on a map.
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  One accumulated the data are incorporated into a system: in a sense, the now cease to be &laquo;brute facts&raquo;, and instead become &laquo;information&raquo;.
</div>

<div>
  The process of translation is carried out bye the geographer who analyzes the data, performs transformations, and ultimately represents the data in visual output.The output then goes to the end user, who puts the data to use.
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  Maps presents results. We can communicate numbers, stats, info that in  a table would take a lot of time to understand, really quickly and easily.
</div>

<div>
  Maps are important for research:
</div>

  * To illustrate data and operationalize.
  * To present results to the reader.
  * To make the research more transparent.

<div>
  A map organizes the space for the user according to various criteria. But they are not objective. Made for a purpose, an audience, a message.
</div>

<div>
  Symbolized representation of a geographical reality.
</div>

### Historicity of a map

<div>
  The time-dependent understanding of a spatial reality deposited in each unique representation.
</div>

<div>
  I. e. Maps form the medieval ages cannot be read without an understanding of the context.
</div>

<div>
</div>

#### Cartographers

<div>
  No maps give us fully &laquo;objective&raquo; representation of the world. Who produces the map? The cartographer&#8217;s background, education, working conditions and knowledge will affect the content, theme and style of a map. Everyone&#8217;s maps are personal and different.
</div>

### Construction of a space.

<div>
  Space must be visualized on a plane surface. Choices &#8211; Sample and segments &#8211; projection. All approximations of the real shape of the earth. Some aspects of the earth is given less importance.
</div>

### Maps and world view

<div>
  Geographical conception of the world. Maps can communicate values, norms, political views. Deliberately or not.
</div>

### Digitalization

<div>
  Development of analogue paper maps to digital GIS maps. Complexity and demand for the information alters the boundaries for how to we communicate information.  GIS has really changed how we relate to maps.
</div>

<div>
  <strong>But why not paper maps? </strong>They have a fixed scale, no zooming. It has a fixed extent, fixed content, it is only 2D and the content put out to be complete (omitted information).
</div>

<div>
  Still paper maps is historically interesting. Mobile. Simple.
</div>

### Valuable information

<div>
  A picture is worth a thousand words. A map is worth a million bytes.
</div>

<div>
  Spatial relationships. Spatial order and inequality. The map can be used to strengthen a specific message.
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  An outdated understanding of maps:
</div>

> <div>
>   &laquo;The role of a map is to present a factual statement about a geographical reality&raquo;. (Robinson 1960)
> </div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  A more reflected understanding:
</div>

> <div>
>   &laquo;A map is a data model that intervenes between reality and database&raquo;
> </div>
> 
> <div>
>   (Goodchild 1992)
> </div>

<div>
  All these transformation processes have people involved. These people undertake conceptualizations, interpretations, reflections, decisions and actions.
</div>

<div>
</div>

### Creativity vs. mechanic

<div>
  Downs 1997 (pensum) is concerned with how GIS with it&#8217;s formalized systems and processes, limits the geographer to think geographically (critically).
</div>

<div>
  According to down, this will have negative consequences if GIS become the most used analytical tool in geography..
</div>

<div>
  Important, but not limited to GIS or geography. Our understanding is shaped by our system of concepts and what we view as researchable questions will be controlled by the methods we have knowledge about.
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  It is very important to geographical thinking to understand space. Read this article.
</div>

<div>
  What does this mean to us? In the lab the instructions are specific, and its easy to just push the buttons. But take time to think about the space, what you are representing, and why it is important. So its important to understand the software, but just as important to understand why we make the map, how it represents space, etc.
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  Depending how you brake down your data, your map will show different results from the same data.. Quantiles and equal interval
</div>

### Correlation is not causation!

<div>
  Spatial analysis. Just because there is a spatial pattern, doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean anything, that they are related or the cause of something else.
</div>

### What is maps again?

<div>
  Maps are usually the end product of a GIS workflow
</div>

<div>
  Distinction between formal and &#8230; . Reference and thematic maps.
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  Reference maps give us general information, based on surveys, topology, roads, buildings, etc. Factual information. Concerns the local details.
</div>

<div>
  Thematic maps are what we are gonna be making. Population and statistics. Less factually precise, more information. Conveys different types of information. Different types of maps: Choropleth. Proportional symbols. Dot density. Dasymetric. Isarithmic.
</div>

### Maps as a media for communicating information and misrepresentations

<div>
  The map is a media for storing and communicating information.
</div>

<div>
  An advantage (and danger) is that GIS makes it possible for everyone to make maps, even without basic background knowledge. This is why misrepresentations in maps are common. A three dimensional world on a flat plane, impossible without distortion.
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  5 geographic relations are affected:
</div>

  * Areas
  * Angles
  * Large shapes
  * Distances
  * Directions

<div>
  Some projection take care of some of the relations, but not all at the same time&#8230; That&#8217;s why projections are really important. All data and all layers must be in the same projection.
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Generalizations</span>: Because we cannot register details for every single space on earth, we cannot make representation of everything, we need to generalize and simplify the reality.
</div>

<div>
  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Symbol use</span>: Different use of symbols can overemphasize properties at the expense of others. Deliberately or not.
</div>

<div>
  Map is a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">snapshot</span> of a dynamic world. Representations at another time, would make a different map.
</div>

<div>
  Maps can be <span style="text-decoration: underline;">extremely complex</span>, and include complex symbology hard to read.
</div>

<div>
  Unavoidably, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">uncertainty</span> in maps, similar to other geographic information.
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  It is easy to lie about reality with a map.
</div>

### Map design principles

<div>
  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Purpose</span> with a map is to make guidance of what should be in the map and how it should be represented.
</div>

<div>
  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Shape</span> of the mapped area (ie. Norway, north/south, east/west)
</div>

<div>
  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">How to use data</span>: Raster (grid cell/pixels) or vector (points, lines and polygons)
</div>

<div>
  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Scale</span> will limit what we can include
</div>

<div>
  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The reader</span>: Children, decision-makers, orienteering runner will all have different demands for a map. Colorblind, visually impaired.
</div>

<div>
  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Area of use</span>: Indoor/outdoor, lighting. On your phone, big, small etc.
</div>

<div>
  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Technical limitations</span>: Internet use or local server hosted map solutions.
</div>

</div>

### What is included in a good map?

<div>
  Title, inset map, map body, legend, North arrow, projection,  scale.
</div>

<div>
  Metadata: data source, author, date.
</div>

<div>
</div>

### Different classifications on thematic maps

<div>
  This is important when you have lots of data. You have to break down the data into different categories. Different classifications produce different results. Described well in the text book.
</div>

<div>
  Natural breaks &#8211; natural divisions in the data
</div>

<div>
  Equal interval &#8211; same as quantile, more categories.
</div>

<div>
  Quantiles &#8211; break it up to predetermined categories, equal number of observations in each categories.
</div>

<div>
  Geometric intervals &#8211;
</div>

<div>
  Standard deviations &#8211; the mean of the data, categorize above and below the mean.
</div>

</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  Whoever is making a map have a lot of power to define. What you choose to include or exclude, where to draw borders, etc. Always remember the curvature of the earth.
