_Richard Swedberg, __On Theory Pictures, Theorizing Diagrams and More_

Using visual tools for theorizing. In social science there is too much emphasis on the end product, the theory, and not enough on the process. The visual culture of sociology is not much developed (such as e. g. communication studies, literature, STS, the natural sciences&#8230;). Also visualizing data is on the agenda of sociology today in a big way. You want to avoid the hairball network.

But can we also visualize theory? What exactly would that entail.  Can visualization be of help in theorizing. How would that be possible? You may want to summarize your theory with the help of a drawing. (**A theory picture)**. You may want to draw something to help you work on a theoretical-empirical problem (**Visual sketch**&laquo;) You may also want to think through and even solve a problem with help of diagrams? (**Theorizing picture**)

**Theory pictures &#8211; Michael Lynch.** Used for scientistic purposes . to look scientific. Also ironic use, Latour and Garfinkel. Parsons AGIL can easily be drawn as a theory picture.

They are useful as an abstract, good for the memory, good for teaching. The Coleman bathtub. There are good as well as bad theory pictures.

Angular lines, well designed. Another good example is Merton&#8217;s theory of social structure by ???.

Theory pictures are helpful as: Quick summary. Aid for you memory. Tool for teaching.Good ones are: Clear. Economic. Expressive. True to the original theory.

**Theorizing diagrams**

Can you think in pictures? Can you also think in pictures when you try to theorize and solve social science problems? Can you theorize better in this way?

A few famous individuals who have thought in terms of pictures.

> &laquo;I do not think I ever reflect in words: I employ visual diagrams, firstly because this way of thinking is my natural language of self-communication, and secondly, because iI am convinced it is the best system for the purpose.&raquo; &#8211; Pierce

> &laquo;Translating algebra back into geometry, and then thinking in terms of geometric shapes&raquo; &#8211; Mandelbrot

_Visual thinking &#8211;_ Rudolf Arnheim

_Visuospatial reasoning &#8211;_ Modern cognitive science

_cf. Visual intelligence_ &#8211; Donald Hoffman

Thinking is multi-modal in nature. The most sustained thinking on how to use visualization to theorize and solve theoretical problems has been made by Pierce.

1# His famous so-called Existential Graphs.

2# Diagrams used by scientists trying to solve problems.

Kepler draws, omitting all that was accidental, observing suggestive relations between the parts of his diagram, performing diverse experiments upon it. Do any such diagrams already exist..? A diagram that allows you to work out a solution to a sociological problem with its help. When you use it, you draw on visual thinking, either complement verbal thinking or even replace it. It has to be open, it allows you multiple solutions. Interact with empirical reality

Swedberg has found none.

&nbsp;

The idea of using visual thinking to create theory and to solve theoretical problems is still useful and worth keeping. Coleman&#8217;s bathtub can be played with and used in a theorizing way. How did he use it? Webers theory can be placed in the trapezoid. How have others used it? Used to identify social mechanisms. Added meso level by organizational sociologists,.

Suggestions from Swedberg. Macro to micro: How is this done, by coercion, imitation, persuasion? Micro to micro: Accept/reject subconsciously, explisit dialogue to self.

We get a very good general view of the process involved (Gestalt).  Our focus is drawn to the points where theoretical choices have been made and can be made. We can add to the theoretical structure of a basic model. We can get ideas for empirical research.

**Theorizing diagrams #2**

What would a theorizing diagram in sociology look like?

  * It should indicate som general directions for how to proceed
  * It should also be open
  * By working on the diagram, in combination with the empirical material, something new should happen.

Incorporate meaning. Interaction between two actors. Webers idea of social action (behavoiur invested with meaning oriented towards someone, interaction when someone responds). Use a few geometrical figures. The small alphabet of theory signs. dot, lines, circle, triangle, rectangle, trapezoid.

&nbsp;

**The visual sketch**

Sit with a problem, draw a little circle and a little line. Always destroyed, few around and hard to study. It is open, but mainly in sense of being vague. Vagueness has a functional role in that it helps the designer to avoid over-commitment to those aspects of the design to which she is not ready to commit to.A sketch is never published. Private = you dont have to show it to others (no anxiety)

A sketch has an element of playfulness. Darwins evolutionary tree from a Gudmund Hernes book.

**Summing up**

The visual culture of sociology needs to be strengthened. Visualizing data is part of this: so should visualizing theory. The idea of theory pictures and visual sketches are straightforward; that of theorizing diagrams much less so &#8211; but potentially more rewarding and interesting, and therefore deserves to be explored. Visual thinking should be on the agenda of sociology.

This means that we need to know much more about visualization and how it can be used to theorize than we do today. We should try to put together a catalogue of existing visual figures. Further develop the alphabet of theory figures
