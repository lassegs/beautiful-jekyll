  <strong>Group project</strong>2-3 people pr group. Due date 10 december. Demonstrate the skills you&#8217;ve developed during the course.Sample projects: Does the presence/absence of bike paths have an impact on the rate of bicycle accidents in Oslo? Where should a new swimming hall be located? How has segregation changed over time?We will be using [the proprietary] software ArcGIS . We will be using data in Excel and databases, as well as ArcGIS.</p> 
  
  <h3>
    Why take this course?
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    GIS is an important tool, not only in the society and planning, but also in social scientific research. It can represent complex issues visually, generally in the form of maps.  Take it for your own research, take it for an upcoming job. GIS competence is attractive.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    GIS is important because almost everything that happens can be spatially referenced. We can map things and happenings based on their coordinates. Then analyze it. Spatial coordinates tells us where something is happening, and spatial analysis tells us about phenomenons and their spatial relations.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    GIS is used every day. Google Maps for example. We will be doing a  more complex things. Point data and line data.
  </p>
  
  <h3>
    What is GIS?
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    General Definition: Geographic Information Systems (GIS) is a computer based system for collecting, analyzing and presenting geographic data. Taking abstract data, numbers in a spreadsheet, and represent them spatially.
  </p>
  
  <h3>
    <strong>History of GIS:</strong>
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    Innovation phase (1957 &#8211; 1977) &#8211; basic tech development, concepts.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Commercial phase &#8211; (1978 &#8211; 1998) Cheaper IT equipment combines with increased computing power made GIS markets expand. Still pretty expensive, crude and complex
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Expansion phase  (1999 &#8211; now) Cheaper and improved software, wider options of products, more free software, expansions and technological development.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    GIS is still a heavy computer task.
  </p>
  
  <h3>
    Ideographic &#8211; nomothetic
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    Ideographic: Nomothetic.  Generalizing vs exploring. In a way GIS transcends it. We can take general information and combine with specific information.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Critiques of GIS as a tool for society&#8217;s most privileged and contributes to strengthen assymetrical power relations. Not a tool for the excluded. But open source, cheaper. [And <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sukey">Sukey</a> ]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Critique of GIS as an excluded tool, with a a need for a wider audience. Crowd sourcing of mapping.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Limited data capability makes data homogenous. Minority excluded. But more data capability coming each year.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Critique of GIS as a quantitative only tool. But more qualitative research has been done with it recently.
  </p>

  <h3>
    GI-Systems / GI-Science
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    GI-systems is a tool for GI science (Reference systems, databases, relations, spatial statistics).
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Geographic information has special properties. The data has a spatial existence. Things that are close have more in common. It is distributed over the surface of the earth, data on a sphere, while in GIS it will be on a flat surface. Geographic data is often big data, lots of it. Data points on a map vs. data in a spreadsheet.

  <h3>
    What can we use GIS for?
  </h3>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      Location &#8211; Where is it?
    </li>
    <li>
      Properties &#8211; what is is?
    </li>
    <li>
      Trends &#8211; changes over time.
    </li>
    <li>
      Patterns &#8211; for example patterns in the urban landscape
    </li>
    <li>
      Distances, routing, network analysis &#8211; calculate distances, fastest route, etc.
    </li>
    <li>
      Modelling (what if&#8230;? (Predicting penomena or objects)
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>
    Spatial and non-spatial referenced information
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    Some data has geographic properties, longitude &#8211; latitude, X Y. Some data does not.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Shapefiles are vector shapes, like vector based drawing (Inkscape for example).
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      Spreadsheet &#8211; Attribute table
    </li>
    <li>
      Geographic information &#8211; shapefile
